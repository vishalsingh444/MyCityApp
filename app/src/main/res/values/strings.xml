    <string name="cafe_recommendation_detail_1">Located a little far from the city. this place is known for its beautifully brewed coffees and breakfast platters.
        Its decor, neither too extravagant nor shabbily done, is an absolute win.
        Live music and a lovely ambience together complement the food here which is delectable.
        They even have a collection of board and card games for you to kill time with as the service can be a tad slow. Visit during karaoke nights for an experience you will remember.
        Reservations are recommended.\n\n

    <string name="cafe_recommendation_detail_2">Bungalow-turned-Cafe, this is a cosy little establishment tucked away from the busier roads of the city. The ambience is very home-like and spells out tranquillity through its plain white walls. And if you like to dine in the lap of nature, a well-maintained garden awaits you in the backyard. The menu offers a plethora of options apart from the coffee which is roasted and brewed in-house. Coffees from the \'Artisan Blends\', \'Pour-Over\' and \'Cold Brew\' sections especially are a must try. Drop in by 10 AM for a scrumptious breakfast.<br/><br/><br/>

    <string name="cafe_recommendation_detail_3">A cafe that doesn\'t feel like a cafe - true to its name, you will get the feeling of being seated in an area filled with autumn greenery. A quiet courtyard of a bungalow, if you will. With distressed, mismatched furniture and artefacts adorning every nook and cranny of this place, it almost gives out Bohemian vibes. Their brunch menu is diverse. You may opt for indoor seating as well if the weather gods are too harsh. Impressively, they have a neat little solution for that - mist spraying table fans.<br/><br/><br/>
        Must-try dishes: English breakfast, Mocktails, Pasta<br/>Location: Road 41, Jubilee Hills<br/>Cost for two: INR 1000

    <string name="cafe_recommendation_detail_4">Sit back, relax and have a good time at this quaint little art gallery-cum-cafe if you are looking for a casual yet soothing vibe. The decor is minimalistic, and the art pieces speak for themselves against the serene white walls. They even provide stationery to diners to create their masterpieces. And here\'s some respite for vegetarians in the meat-loving city of Hyderabad: this place serves pure vegetarian food.<br/><br/><br/>
